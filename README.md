# Links for Perfex

A powerful Perfex CRM module that adds comprehensive link management functionality to both tasks and projects.

## Features

- ✅ **Task Links**: Add, edit, and delete links within individual tasks
- ✅ **Project Links**: Full link management with dedicated "Links" tab in project views
- ✅ **Rich Link Data**: URL, title, description, and automatic icon detection
- ✅ **Smart UI**: Integrated forms (no popups), real-time updates, responsive design
- ✅ **Permissions**: Respects Perfex CRM's existing permission system
- ✅ **Demo Fallback**: Shows sample links when no real links exist

## Installation

1. **Upload Module**: Copy the `links_for_perfex` folder to your Perfex CRM's `modules/` directory

2. **Activate Module**: Go to **Setup → Modules** and activate "Links for Perfex"

3. **Database Setup**: The database table is created automatically during activation

## Uninstall

**⚠️ Important**: Uninstall behavior depends on your environment:

- **Development Environment** (`ENVIRONMENT === 'development'`): Complete uninstall with database table deletion and all data removal
- **Production/Other Environments**: Safe uninstall that preserves all data (only deactivates the module)

To uninstall:
1. Go to **Setup → Modules**
2. Find "Links for Perfex" and click **Uninstall**
3. Confirm the action

**Note**: This environment-based behavior ensures data safety in production while allowing complete cleanup in development.

  `addedfrom` int NOT NULL,
  `last_modified` timestamp DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),

  INDEX `idx_addedfrom` (`addedfrom`),
  INDEX `idx_dateadded` (`dateadded`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```
